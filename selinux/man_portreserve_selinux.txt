NAME
       portreserve_selinux - Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the portreserve processes

DESCRIPTION
       Security-Enhanced Linux secures the portreserve processes via flexible mandatory access control.

       The  portreserve processes execute with the portreserve_t SELinux type. You can check if you have these processes running by execut‚Äê
       ing the ps command with the -Z qualifier.

       For example:

       ps -eZ | grep portreserve_t



ENTRYPOINTS
       The portreserve_t SELinux type can be entered via the portreserve_exec_t file type.

       The default entrypoint paths for the portreserve_t domain are the following:

       /sbin/portreserve, /usr/sbin/portreserve

PROCESS TYPES
       SELinux defines process types (domains) for each process running on the system

       You can see the context of a process using the -Z option to ps

       Policy governs the access confined processes have to files.  SELinux portreserve policy is very flexible  allowing  users  to  setup
       their portreserve processes in as secure a method as possible.

       The following process types are defined for portreserve:

       portreserve_t

       Note:  semanage  permissive  -a  portreserve_t  can be used to make the process type portreserve_t permissive. SELinux does not deny
       access to permissive process types, but the AVC (SELinux denials) messages are still generated.


BOOLEANS
       SELinux policy is customizable based on least access required.  portreserve policy is extremely flexible and  has  several  booleans
       that allow you to manipulate the policy and run portreserve with the tightest access possible.



       If  you  want to allow users to resolve user passwd entries directly from ldap rather then using a sssd server, you must turn on the
       authlogin_nsswitch_use_ldap boolean. Disabled by default.

       setsebool -P nscd_use_shm 1



MANAGED FILES
       The SELinux process type portreserve_t can manage files labeled with the following file types.  The paths  listed  are  the  default
       paths for these file types.  Note the processes UID still need to have DAC permissions.

       cluster_conf_t

            /etc/cluster(/.*)?

       cluster_var_lib_t

            /var/lib/pcsd(/.*)?

FILE CONTEXTS
       SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type.

       You can see the context of a file using the -Z option to ls

       Policy  governs  the  access  confined processes have to these files.  SELinux portreserve policy is very flexible allowing users to
       setup their portreserve processes in as secure a method as possible.

       STANDARD FILE CONTEXT

       SELinux defines the file context types for the portreserve, if you wanted to store files with these types in a  diffent  paths,  you
       need to execute the semanage command to sepecify alternate labeling and then use restorecon to put the labels on disk.

       semanage fcontext -a -t portreserve_var_run_t '/srv/myportreserve_content(/.*)?'
       restorecon -R -v /srv/myportreserve_content

       Note: SELinux often uses regular expressions to specify labels that match multiple files.

       The following file types are defined for portreserve:



       portreserve_etc_t

       - Set files with the portreserve_etc_t type, if you want to store portreserve files in the /etc directories.



       portreserve_exec_t

       - Set files with the portreserve_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the portreserve_t domain.


       Paths:
            /sbin/portreserve, /usr/sbin/portreserve


       portreserve_initrc_exec_t

       - Set files with the portreserve_initrc_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the portreserve_initrc_t domain.



       portreserve_var_run_t

       - Set files with the portreserve_var_run_t type, if you want to store the portreserve files under the /run or /var/run directory.



       Note:  File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanently change the file context you need
       to use the semanage fcontext command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use restorecon to apply the
       labels.


COMMANDS
       semanage fcontext can also be used to manipulate default file context mappings.

       semanage permissive can also be used to manipulate whether or not a process type is permissive.

       semanage module can also be used to enable/disable/install/remove policy modules.

       semanage boolean can also be used to manipulate the booleans


       system-config-selinux is a GUI tool available to customize SELinux policy settings.
